-- ReadMe Grey-v1.4.0
	Grey is a Java Based Device Check-in Application. The idea was gotten from an IT firm which used 
	a manual method(Log Book) to check-in their devices. It took a while to check-in a device which 
	included writing down staff name, device serial number etc. Being an IT firm and using such a way 
	to do things was insufficient. So we decided to modernize it and make it technical.
	
-- Manual
	- Before a device can check-in or check-out, the device has to be registered.
	- Also, it has to be tied to a staff.
	- After registering the device, you register the staff.
	- NOTE: When registering a staff, there is a drop down for device, you then select the device you just registered.
	- The device drop down shows devices that haven't been assigned to anyone so, No worries!
	- Device has now been enrolled and is ready for use..
	- To confirm, scan device barcode to see if it is registered.
	- To Check-in, scan device barcode when home screen textfield is on focus, Device information is been displayed including staff Picture
	for at least 1-factor identification, select Check-in Destination and Boooom!! Check-in is successful.
	- To Confirm, check daily report or general report. The same goes for Checking-out.
	- Other features include connection settings which is not to be temperred with. Simply type in the hardware server host, port(3306 is default),
	Username, Password and Database name.
	- A user can as well view list of all devices, all staff, all staff with devices they possess, view report of a device and print all of these too!
	Nothing more... Straightforward!!..
